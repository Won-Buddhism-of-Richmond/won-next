    "about_won_paragraphs": [
      "Won-Buddhism, a reformed and modernized Buddhism, teaches us how to use our minds. To use the mind well, we should first know what the mind is like and how it works. Based on that understanding, we should cultivate and use it skillfully in everyday situations.",
      "The name Won-Buddhism (Won-Bul-Kyo in Korean) is a compound word for truth, enlightenment, and teaching. Won means circle and symbolizes the ultimate truth. Bul means enlightenment, and Kyo means teaching the truth. Therefore, Won-Buddhism is the path that leads us to become enlightened to the truth.",
      "Won-Buddhism is a religion that teaches us how to use our minds. Our lives and this world are the manifestations of our minds, so the knowledge of how to use our minds is fundamental and the key to leading happy and successful lives."
